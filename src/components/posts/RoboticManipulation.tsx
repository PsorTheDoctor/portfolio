    <Title>Solving robotic manipulation problems</Title>
    <p>My bachelor thesis under the supervising of PhD Adam Wolniakowski.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this thesis was to develop a solution that allows for recognition of a
    given object and perform grasping of it by a manipulator. The further development of the
    problem known as bin picking aims at increasing a scope of industrial robotsâ€™ operation in
    a context of their work. It is quintessential in many modern robotic applications targeted
    for being more dexterous and intuitive.</p>

    <p>All in all, the work is not self-sufficient system that would fulfill the industarial requirements in its current
    state. Anyway, the project has a potential to become a part of larger software, where it would add
    a significant value on the fields of manipulation and industry 4.0.</p>
